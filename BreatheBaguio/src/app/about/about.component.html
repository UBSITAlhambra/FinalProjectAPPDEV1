            <p class="card-text">
              SDG 11 stands for <strong>Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong>. It aims to make cities inclusive,
              safe, resilient, and sustainable. It addresses challenges like pollution, lack of housing, poor infrastructure,
              and climate vulnerabilityâ€”issues many cities, including Baguio, are facing.

            <p class="card-text">
              Baguio faces urban sprawl, landslides, increasing waste, traffic congestion, and unpredictable weather due to climate change.
              Its mountainous geography makes it especially vulnerable to heavy rains, deforestation, and environmental degradation.
              Overpopulation and unmanaged development also threaten its long-term sustainability.
